# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
My motivation was to help people be prepared for the weather. I built this project to help people see the weather before going to a place and them not being prepared. This project solves the problem of not knowing what the weather is going to be before you get there. I learned how to use an API key and implement it into my project.
